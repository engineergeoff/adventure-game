This folder was just made as an experiment by Brendan.

The idea for Trello is that it is used as a task setting application, but it
also has a really good API, so technically we can use it for free like a db
by using the API with tokens etc.. to store data.

Probably wont work so i was just testing it here.

Could eventually be used to store player names for a leaderboard.
